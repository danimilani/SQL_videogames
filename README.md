# SQL PROJECT - GOLDEN AGE OF VIDEO GAMES

## Project in SQL to analyze the golden age of videogames. We explore the top 400 best-selling video games created between 1977 and 2020. We'll compare a dataset on game sales with critic and user reviews to determine whether or not video games have improved as the gaming market has grown.

## Scope:


1. Check some of the top selling video games of all time.
<br>

SQL Query: <br>
![Alt text](/screenshots/vg1.JPG)

Result: <br>
![Alt text](/screenshots/vg1a.JPG)

2. Check how many games on the game_sales table don't have any reviews data. 
<br>

SQL Query: <br>
![Alt text](/screenshots/vg2.JPG)

Result: <br>
![Alt text](/screenshots/vg2a.JPG)

3. Check what the critics think - the average critic score per year, limiting by 10 results.
<br>

SQL Query: <br>
![Alt text](/screenshots/vg3.JPG)

Result: <br>
![Alt text](/screenshots/vg3a.JPG)

4. Update the previous query so it only returns years that have more than four reviewed games.
<br>

SQL Query: <br>
![Alt text](/screenshots/vg4.JPG)

Result: <br>
![Alt text](/screenshots/vg4a.JPG)

5. Check which years dropped off the list due to having four or fewer reviewed games.
<br>

SQL Query: <br>
![Alt text](/screenshots/vg5.JPG)

Result: <br>
![Alt text](/screenshots/vg5a.JPG)

6. Check the opinion of the players, looking at the average user score per year, limiting results by 10.
<br>

SQL Query: <br>
![Alt text](/screenshots/vg6.JPG)

Result: <br>
![Alt text](/screenshots/vg6a.JPG)

7. Check what are the years that both players and critics loved.
<br>

SQL Query: <br>
![Alt text](/screenshots/vg7.JPG)

Result: <br>
![Alt text](/screenshots/vg7a.JPG)

8. We know that critics and players liked these years, but we need to check if the sales were good in those years.

SQL Query: <br>
![Alt text](/screenshots/vg8.JPG)

Result: <br>
